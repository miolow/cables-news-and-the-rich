# Cable News and The Rich
A text analysis project which looks at how American ideological news networks like Fox News and MSNBC portray the rich over time (2006-2013).

## Introduction
In this project, I looked utilized dictionary analysis to examine how ideological news networks like Fox News and MSNBC portray the rich. I am curious as to whether there are differences in the way the two news networks discuss about the rich. 

### Why study these portrayals?
Given the rising popularity of discussions on taxing the rich and Democratic political candidates who champion issues pertaining to raising taxes on the rich, it would be interesting to see how the rich, the group that is implicated in this discourse, is discussed in the media.
